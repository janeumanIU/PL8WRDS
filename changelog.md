## Version 1.0 #
* Changed game modes to INFINITE (∞), 60 SECOND (60S), and CLASSIC (CLS).
  * INFINITE and 60 SECOND modes include tiered bonus points for getting more than one word right on a given prompt.
  * INFINITE mode also includes tiered time bonuses for getting more than one word right on a given prompt.
  * CLS mode does not include either new bonus systems.
  * Timers have all been changed to 60 seconds (replacing the timer for the 3 MINUTE (3MN) and previous INFINITE (∞) modes).
* Changed button art to correspond to the new modes.
* Added a new ABOUT panel to explain the new modes.
* Changed the HIGHSCORE panel to reflect the new modes.
* Simplified the HIGHSCORE panel to one value for each mode.
* Cumulative, prompt-specific bonus points are now displayed above the score during gameplay.
* Unpausing no longer immediately restarts the timer; the prompt must be refreshed to restart it.
* The pause menu is now accessible before the timer starts (e.g., in case the player wanted to choose a different mode).
* Highscores are now updated in real-time rather than at GAME OVER (i.e., so if the game crashes, or the game session is abandoned, scores are still recorded).
* Audio now correctly plays for all buttons.
* Changed the splash screen so it's not just the Unity logo.
* Enabled a banner ad above the main menu (just to try it out; if it generates complaints or other issues, it will be removed in v1.1)
